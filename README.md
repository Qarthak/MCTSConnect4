# MCTSConnect4

This program pits two MCTS algorithm against each other in a match of Connect4. One makes a move based on 40 playouts while other does 200 playouts

There are variables in the code to change the size of the board and the number of connection required to win the game and even if you want to play yourself against the MCTS. By default, MCTS40 plays against MCTS200 but this can also be changed
